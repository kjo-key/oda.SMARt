        <h1>Computer Network Concepts</h1>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>1. Basics of Computer Networks</h2>
            <p>A <strong>computer network</strong> is a system of interconnected devices that communicate with each other to share resources, data, and services. The devices in a network could be computers, servers, switches, routers, and other networking hardware. The goal of a computer network is to enable communication and resource sharing among users and devices.</p>
            <h3>Key Components of a Computer Network:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Nodes</strong>: Devices connected to the network (computers, printers, etc.).</li>
                <li><strong>Links</strong>: Communication channels that connect the nodes (e.g., cables, wireless signals).</li>
                <li><strong>Switches and Routers</strong>: Devices that help forward and direct data across networks.</li>
                <li><strong>Protocols</strong>: A set of rules that dictate how data is transmitted over the network (e.g., TCP/IP, HTTP, FTP).</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>2. Types of Computer Networks</h2>
            <p>Computer networks can be categorized based on their geographical spread or architecture.</p>
            <h3>a. Based on Geographical Area:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>LAN (Local Area Network)</strong>: A network that connects computers within a limited area, such as a home, school, or office building.</li>
                <li><strong>WAN (Wide Area Network)</strong>: A network that connects computers over a large geographical area, often across cities, countries, or even continents.</li>
                <li><strong>MAN (Metropolitan Area Network)</strong>: A network that spans a city or large campus. It's larger than a LAN but smaller than a WAN.</li>
                <li><strong>PAN (Personal Area Network)</strong>: A small network typically used for connecting personal devices (e.g., connecting a smartphone to a laptop via Bluetooth).</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>b. Based on Network Architecture:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Client-Server Network</strong>: The server provides resources or services, and clients request them.</li>
                <li><strong>Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Network</strong>: Devices act as both clients and servers, sharing resources with one another.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>3. Network Topologies</h2>
            <p>The <strong>topology</strong> defines the layout or structure of a network. It describes how the devices are connected.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Bus Topology</strong>: All devices are connected to a single central cable (the bus). It's simple but can be slow and prone to failure.</li>
                <li><strong>Star Topology</strong>: All devices are connected to a central device like a hub or switch. It's reliable, but if the central device fails, the whole network goes down.</li>
                <li><strong>Ring Topology</strong>: Each device is connected to two other devices, forming a ring. Data travels in one direction around the ring.</li>
                <li><strong>Mesh Topology</strong>: Devices are interconnected, creating multiple paths for data to travel. This is used in large, mission-critical networks.</li>
                <li><strong>Hybrid Topology</strong>: A combination of two or more topologies.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>4. Network Devices</h2>
            <p>Several devices are involved in the creation and functioning of a network:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Router</strong>: Routes data between different networks.</li>
                <li><strong>Switch</strong>: Connects devices within the same network and uses MAC addresses to forward data to the correct device.</li>
                <li><strong>Hub</strong>: An outdated device that broadcasts data to all devices in a network.</li>
                <li><strong>Modem</strong>: Converts digital data into analog signals to allow communication over phone lines or cable systems.</li>
                <li><strong>Access Point</strong>: Provides wireless access to the network, often used in Wi-Fi networks.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>5. Network Protocols</h2>
            <p>Protocols define the rules for data transmission. Some common networking protocols include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol)</strong>: The fundamental suite of protocols for the internet.</li>
                <li><strong>HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)</strong>: Used for transferring web pages and other content over the internet.</li>
                <li><strong>FTP (File Transfer Protocol)</strong>: Used for transferring files between computers.</li>
                <li><strong>SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol)</strong>: Used for sending emails.</li>
                <li><strong>DNS (Domain Name System)</strong>: Resolves human-readable domain names into IP addresses.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>6. OSI Model</h2>
            <p>The <strong>OSI (Open Systems Interconnection)</strong> model is a conceptual framework used to understand network communication by dividing the process into seven layers:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Physical Layer</strong>: Deals with hardware connections and data transmission mediums.</li>
                <li><strong>Data Link Layer</strong>: Ensures reliable communication between devices on the same network.</li>
                <li><strong>Network Layer</strong>: Handles addressing, routing, and forwarding of data packets across different networks.</li>
                <li><strong>Transport Layer</strong>: Ensures error-free data transfer between devices.</li>
                <li><strong>Session Layer</strong>: Manages communication sessions between devices.</li>
                <li><strong>Presentation Layer</strong>: Handles data encoding, encryption, and translation.</li>
                <li><strong>Application Layer</strong>: Interfaces with software applications and provides network services directly to the user.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>7. IP Addressing and Subnetting</h2>
            <p>An <strong>IP address</strong> uniquely identifies a device on a network. There are two main versions of IP addresses:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>IPv4</strong>: The most widely used, consisting of 32 bits.</li>
                <li><strong>IPv6</strong>: A newer version designed to solve the problem of IPv4 address exhaustion. It uses 128-bit addresses.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Subnetting</strong> is the practice of dividing an IP address into smaller sub-networks (subnets).</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>8. Network Security</h2>
            <p>Network security involves protecting data, devices, and infrastructure from unauthorized access, misuse, or attack. Key components include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Firewalls</strong>: Devices or software that control network traffic.</li>
                <li><strong>Encryption</strong>: The process of encoding data to prevent unauthorized access.</li>
                <li><strong>VPN (Virtual Private Network)</strong>: Provides secure communication channels over the internet.</li>
                <li><strong>IDS/IPS (Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems)</strong>: Tools used to detect and prevent network security breaches.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>9. Wireless Networks</h2>
            <p>Wireless networks use radio waves to transmit data without physical cables. Common standards include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Wi-Fi (IEEE 802.11)</strong>: The standard for wireless local area networks (WLANs).</li>
                <li><strong>Bluetooth</strong>: A short-range wireless technology.</li>
                <li><strong>Cellular Networks</strong>: Networks like 4G and 5G providing mobile data connectivity.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>10. Network Performance and Troubleshooting</h2>
            <p>Network performance is measured by bandwidth, latency, and packet loss. Tools for troubleshooting include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Ping</strong>: A command-line tool to test connectivity.</li>
                <li><strong>Traceroute</strong>: Traces the path packets take to reach their destination.</li>
