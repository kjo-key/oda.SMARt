    <p>Your Deep Dive into Chemistry</p>
  </header>

  <section class="content">
    <h2>1. Chemical Reactions: A Deeper Look</h2>
    <p>Chemical reactions are processes in which substances, called <strong>reactants</strong>, are transformed into new substances called <strong>products</strong>. These reactions involve <strong>rearrangement</strong> of atoms and bonds. The process follows certain principles, primarily the <strong>law of conservation of mass</strong>, which states that matter is neither created nor destroyed during a chemical reaction.</p>

    <h3>Energy in Chemical Reactions:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Exothermic reactions</strong>: Release energy (usually in the form of heat) to the surroundings. For example, combustion reactions (like burning wood or gasoline) release energy.</li>
      <li><strong>Endothermic reactions</strong>: Absorb energy from the surroundings. Photosynthesis is an example, where plants absorb energy from sunlight to convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose and oxygen.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Activation Energy:</h3>
    <p>To start a chemical reaction, energy is needed to break bonds in the reactants. This minimum energy required is called the <strong>activation energy</strong>. The <strong>transition state</strong> or <strong>activated complex</strong> is a high-energy, unstable state that occurs during the reaction.</p>

    <h3>Mechanisms of Chemical Reactions:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Collision Theory</strong>: In order for a reaction to occur, reactant particles must collide with each other with sufficient energy (activation energy) and proper orientation.</li>
      <li><strong>Reaction Mechanisms</strong>: Some reactions proceed in steps, known as the <strong>reaction mechanism</strong>. The rate-determining step is the slowest step in this sequence, controlling how quickly the reaction occurs.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Equilibrium in Reactions:</h3>
    <p><strong>Dynamic equilibrium</strong> occurs when the rate of the forward reaction equals the rate of the reverse reaction. This happens in reversible reactions, where reactants are converted to products, and products can also convert back to reactants.</p>
    <p>The <strong>equilibrium constant (K)</strong> is a measure of the concentrations of reactants and products at equilibrium for a particular reaction.</p>

    <h3>Factors Affecting Reaction Rates:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Concentration of reactants</strong>: A higher concentration increases the number of collisions between reactants, speeding up the reaction.</li>
      <li><strong>Temperature</strong>: Raising the temperature increases the kinetic energy of molecules, leading to more frequent and more energetic collisions.</li>
      <li><strong>Catalysts</strong>: Catalysts speed up reactions by lowering the activation energy without being consumed in the reaction.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. Stoichiometry: A Deeper Dive</h2>
    <p>Stoichiometry is the branch of chemistry that deals with the calculation of reactants and products in chemical reactions. It relies heavily on the concept of <strong>moles</strong> and <strong>molar ratios</strong>.</p>

    <h3>Moles and Molar Mass:</h3>
    <p>The <strong>mole</strong> is the fundamental unit in stoichiometry, representing <strong>6.022 × 10<sup>23</sup></strong> entities (atoms, molecules, ions, etc.), known as <strong>Avogadro's Number</strong>.</p>
    <p>The <strong>molar mass</strong> is the mass of one mole of a substance, expressed in grams per mole. It is numerically equivalent to the molecular weight of the compound (sum of atomic masses from the periodic table).</p>

    <h3>Example of Mole-to-Mole Conversion (Molar Ratio):</h3>
    <p>For example, consider the reaction:</p>
    <pre>N₂ (g) + 3H₂ (g) → 2NH₃ (g)</pre>
    <p>The mole ratio between nitrogen and hydrogen is 1:3, meaning 1 mole of nitrogen reacts with 3 moles of hydrogen. Similarly, the mole ratio between nitrogen and ammonia is 1:2.</p>

    <h3>Stoichiometric Steps with Example:</h3>
    <p>Let’s now explore stoichiometric calculations in detail with a step-by-step breakdown:</p>
    <h4>Example Problem:</h4>
    <p>How many grams of <strong>NH₃</strong> (ammonia) are produced from 10.0 grams of <strong>N₂</strong> (nitrogen) in the reaction:</p>
    <pre>N₂ (g) + 3H₂ (g) → 2NH₃ (g)</pre>

    <h5>Solution:</h5>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Write the balanced equation.</li>
      <li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Convert grams of N₂ to moles.</li>
      <li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Use the mole ratio to calculate moles of NH₃.</li>
      <li><strong>Step 4:</strong> Convert moles of NH₃ to grams.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Limiting Reactant and Excess Reactant:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Limiting Reactant:</strong> In many reactions, the amount of one reactant can limit the reaction, called the <strong>limiting reactant</strong>.</li>
      <li><strong>Excess Reactant:</strong> This is the reactant that remains after the reaction has completed.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Law of Conservation of Mass:</h3>
    <p>This law states that mass is neither created nor destroyed in a chemical reaction. Therefore, the mass of the products should equal the mass of the reactants:</p>
    <pre>Mass of reactants = Mass of products</pre>

    <h2>3. Advanced Stoichiometry Concepts:</h2>
    <h3>Ideal Gas Law in Stoichiometry:</h3>
    <p>For gases, stoichiometry often involves the <strong>Ideal Gas Law</strong>, given by:</p>
    <pre>PV = nRT</pre>
    <p>Where:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>P</strong> = Pressure (in atm or Pa)</li>
      <li><strong>V</strong> = Volume (in liters or m³)</li>
      <li><strong>n</strong> = Number of moles</li>
      <li><strong>R</strong> = Ideal gas constant (0.0821 L·atm / mol·K)</li>
      <li><strong>T</strong> = Temperature (in Kelvin)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>For example, if you want to calculate how many moles of gas are produced in a reaction at standard temperature and pressure (STP, 0°C or 273K, and 1 atm), you can use the molar volume of gases at STP, which is 22.4 L/mol.</p>
