            <h2>Magnetism Overview</h2>
            <p>Magnetism is a force of attraction or repulsion that acts at a distance, created by moving electric charges (current) or the intrinsic magnetic moments of elementary particles. It is one of the fundamental forces of nature, along with gravity, electromagnetism, and the weak and strong nuclear forces.</p>

            <div class="callout">
                <strong>Magnetism and Electricity:</strong> Magnetism is closely related to electricity. A moving electric charge produces a magnetic field, and a changing magnetic field can produce an electric current (as described by <strong>Faraday's Law</strong>).

            <h3>1. Magnetic Fields</h3>
            <p>A magnetic field is a region of space where a magnetic force is exerted on a moving charge or a magnetic dipole (such as a magnet). Magnetic fields are represented by field lines, pointing from the North to the South pole of a magnet. The strength and direction of the magnetic field are defined by <strong>Magnetic Field Strength (B)</strong>, measured in <strong>Tesla (T)</strong>.</p>

            <div class="callout">
                <strong>Magnetic Field Concept:</strong> The magnetic field generated by a magnet is what allows it to attract or repel other materials. The field lines around a magnet show the direction of the magnetic force.
