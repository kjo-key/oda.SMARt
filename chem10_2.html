        <h1>Solutions in Chemistry</h1>
        <p>A Comprehensive Overview of Solutions and Their Properties</p>
    </header>
    <section class="content">
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>In chemistry, a <strong>solution</strong> is a homogeneous mixture composed of two or more substances. The substance present in the largest amount is called the <strong>solvent</strong>, and the substance that is dissolved in the solvent is called the <strong>solute</strong>.</p>
        <p>Solutions can be classified based on the phase of matter of the solvent (liquid, gas, or solid). However, in most cases, when we talk about solutions, we are referring to <strong>liquid solutions</strong>, where the solvent is typically water, though other solvents such as ethanol or acetone can also be used.</p>
        
        <h2>Components of a Solution</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Solvent</strong>: The substance in greater amount that dissolves the solute.</li>
            <li><strong>Solute</strong>: The substance in smaller amount that is dissolved in the solvent.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The combination of solute and solvent results in a <strong>homogeneous mixture</strong>, meaning the composition is uniform throughout the solution.</p>
        
        <h2>Types of Solutions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Gas in Liquid</strong>: Air in water (oxygen dissolved in water).</li>
            <li><strong>Liquid in Liquid</strong>: Alcohol in water (ethanol in water).</li>
            <li><strong>Solid in Liquid</strong>: Salt in water (sodium chloride in water).</li>
            <li><strong>Gas in Gas</strong>: Air (a mixture of gases like oxygen, nitrogen, and carbon dioxide).</li>
            <li><strong>Solid in Solid</strong>: Alloys (such as steel or bronze, which are a mixture of metals).</li>
        </ol>
        
        <h2>Concentration of Solutions</h2>
        <h3>Molarity (M)</h3>
        <p>Molarity is the most commonly used expression of concentration. It is defined as the number of moles of solute per liter of solution.</p>
        <pre>
Molarity (M) = moles of solute / liters of solution
        </pre>
        
        <h3>Molality (m)</h3>
        <p>Molality is the number of moles of solute per kilogram of solvent. Unlike molarity, molality does not depend on the temperature or volume of the solution, as it is based on mass.</p>
        <pre>
Molality (m) = moles of solute / kilograms of solvent
        </pre>
        
        <h3>Normality (N)</h3>
        <p>Normality refers to the number of equivalents of solute per liter of solution. It is used in acid-base chemistry or redox reactions, where the equivalent is defined as the amount of solute that can donate or accept one mole of protons or electrons.</p>
        <pre>
Normality (N) = equivalents of solute / liters of solution
        </pre>
        
        <h3>Mass Percent (w/w%)</h3>
        <p>This expresses the concentration of a solution in terms of the mass of solute per mass of solution.</p>
        <pre>
Mass percent (w/w%) = mass of solute / mass of solution × 100
        </pre>
        
        <h3>Volume Percent (v/v%)</h3>
        <p>This is the volume of solute per volume of solution.</p>
        <pre>
Volume percent (v/v%) = volume of solute / volume of solution × 100
        </pre>
        
        <h3>Parts per Million (ppm) and Parts per Billion (ppb)</h3>
        <p>These units are used to express very dilute solutions, especially in environmental chemistry.</p>
        <pre>
ppm = mass of solute / mass of solution × 10⁶
ppb = mass of solute / mass of solution × 10⁹
        </pre>
        
        <h2>Solution Properties</h2>
        <h3>Boiling Point Elevation (ΔT<sub>b</sub>)</h3>
        <p>The boiling point of a solution is higher than that of the pure solvent. This phenomenon is described by the equation:</p>
        <pre>
ΔT<sub>b</sub> = i × K<sub>b</sub> × m
        </pre>
        
        <h3>Freezing Point Depression (ΔT<sub>f</sub>)</h3>
        <p>The freezing point of a solution is lower than that of the pure solvent. This is described by the equation:</p>
        <pre>
ΔT<sub>f</sub> = i × K<sub>f</sub> × m
        </pre>
        
        <h3>Osmotic Pressure (Π)</h3>
        <p>The pressure required to stop osmosis (the movement of solvent through a semipermeable membrane). It is given by:</p>
        <pre>
Π = i × M × R × T
        </pre>
        
        <h2>Factors Affecting Solubility</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Temperature</strong>: For most solid solutes, solubility increases as the temperature increases. For gases, solubility decreases with an increase in temperature.</li>
            <li><strong>Pressure</strong>: The solubility of gases increases with increasing pressure (as described by Henry’s Law).</li>
            <li><strong>Nature of the Solute and Solvent</strong>: "Like dissolves like" — polar solvents tend to dissolve polar solutes, and nonpolar solvents tend to dissolve nonpolar solutes.</li>
            <li><strong>Particle Size of Solute</strong>: Smaller solute particles dissolve faster because they have more surface area for the solvent to act upon.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Solubility Calculations</h2>
        <h3>Molarity Calculation</h3>
        <p>If we know the moles of solute and the volume of solution, we can calculate the molarity using the formula:</p>
        <pre>
M = n / V
        </pre>
        
        <h3>Dilution Formula</h3>
        <p>When you dilute a concentrated solution, the number of moles of solute remains constant. The equation for dilution is:</p>
        <pre>
M₁ × V₁ = M₂ × V₂
        </pre>
        
        <h2>Colligative Properties</h2>
        <p>Colligative properties depend on the number of solute particles in the solution, not their identity. These include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Boiling point elevation</li>
            <li>Freezing point depression</li>
            <li>Osmotic pressure</li>
            <li>Vapor pressure lowering</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Summary of Key Formulas</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Molarity (M)</strong>: M = moles of solute / liters of solution</li>
            <li><strong>Molality (m)</strong>: m = moles of solute / kilograms of solvent</li>
            <li><strong>Normality (N)</strong>: N = equivalents of solute / liters of solution</li>
            <li><strong>Freezing Point Depression</strong>: ΔT<sub>f</sub> = i × K<sub>f</sub> × m</li>
            <li><strong>Boiling Point Elevation</strong>: ΔT<sub>b</sub> = i × K<sub>b</sub> × m</li>
            <li><strong>Osmotic Pressure</strong>: Π = i × M × R × T</li>
            <li><strong>Dilution Equation</strong>: M₁ × V₁ = M₂ × V₂</li>
            <li><strong>Henry's Law (for gases in liquid)</strong>: C = k<sub>P</sub> × P</li>
        </ul>
