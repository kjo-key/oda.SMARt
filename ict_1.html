            <h2>1. File System Basics</h2>
            <p>A <strong>file system</strong> is a mechanism that determines how data is stored, accessed, and organized on storage devices like hard drives, SSDs, or network-attached storage. File systems define the structure of files, the hierarchy of directories, and how access control and metadata are managed.</p>

            <h3>Key Components of a File System:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>File Name</strong>: Identifies the file within a directory.</li>
                <li><strong>Metadata</strong>: Describes the file's attributes such as size, type, creation/modification date, and permissions.</li>
                <li><strong>File Data</strong>: The actual contents of the file.</li>
                <li><strong>Directory</strong>: A system used to organize files in a hierarchical manner.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>2. Types of File Organization</h2>
            <p>The method chosen for organizing files can greatly affect the speed and efficiency of data access. Here are the main types of file organization:</p>

            <h3>a. Sequential File Organization</h3>
            <p>In sequential file organization, records are stored in a continuous block, one after another, typically sorted in some predefined order (ascending or descending).</p>
            <p><strong>Use Cases:</strong> Batch processing systems, logs, and backup files.</p>
            <p><strong>Access:</strong> Data is accessed in a linear manner. To find a record, the system has to scan each one sequentially.</p>
            <p><strong>Drawback:</strong> Not ideal for large databases because the search process is slow, especially for random access.</p>

            <h3>b. Direct (or Random) File Organization</h3>
            <p>In this method, records are stored at specific addresses calculated using a <code>hash function</code> or some other method to map the record to a specific storage location.</p>
            <p><strong>Use Cases:</strong> Applications requiring fast, direct access to specific records.</p>
            <p><strong>Access:</strong> Direct access allows fast retrieval since the address is known, and no traversal of other records is needed.</p>
            <p><strong>Drawback:</strong> Requires efficient hashing techniques and may lead to collisions (two records being assigned the same location).</p>

            <h3>c. Indexed File Organization</h3>
            <p>Indexed organization uses an index to store pointers to the actual data blocks. The index serves as a look-up table, mapping each record's key to its location.</p>
            <p><strong>Use Cases:</strong> Databases, search engines, and file systems that require fast searches.</p>
            <p><strong>Access:</strong> The system first searches the index for the key, and then directly accesses the data.</p>
            <p><strong>Advantages:</strong> Much faster than sequential searches, and the index structure allows quick access even for large datasets.</p>
            <p><strong>Drawback:</strong> Requires extra space to store the index.</p>

            <h3>d. Clustered File Organization</h3>
            <p>In clustered organization, records with similar characteristics are stored together in clusters. It is often used when thereâ€™s a need to access related data simultaneously.</p>
            <p><strong>Use Cases:</strong> Grouping related records (e.g., all records from the same department or project).</p>
            <p><strong>Access:</strong> Helps optimize access speed when multiple related records need to be accessed at once.</p>
            <p><strong>Advantages:</strong> Reduced disk I/O because related data is stored near each other.</p>
            <p><strong>Drawback:</strong> More complex to manage and might lead to inefficiency in some cases.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>3. File Storage Methods</h2>
            <p>Files can be stored using different methods to manage disk space and optimize access speed. Here are the primary storage methods:</p>

            <h3>a. Contiguous Allocation</h3>
            <p>In this method, each file is stored in a contiguous block of disk space, making it fast to read since all the file's data is stored together.</p>
            <p><strong>Advantages:</strong> Quick access time since the data is contiguous.</p>
            <p><strong>Drawback:</strong> Fragmentation can occur over time as files are deleted and new ones are created, leading to inefficient space utilization.</p>
            <p><strong>Use Cases:</strong> Traditional file systems where speed is important for sequential access.</p>

            <h3>b. Linked Allocation</h3>
            <p>In linked allocation, each file is stored in separate blocks, with each block containing a pointer to the next one.</p>
            <p><strong>Advantages:</strong> It allows non-contiguous storage, thus preventing fragmentation.</p>
            <p><strong>Drawback:</strong> Slower access time due to the need to traverse the linked blocks.</p>
            <p><strong>Use Cases:</strong> Used in systems where files grow dynamically and where contiguous storage is not always available.</p>

            <h3>c. Indexed Allocation</h3>
            <p>In this method, an index block contains pointers to all the file blocks. The index block is stored separately, and the actual file blocks can be anywhere on the disk.</p>
            <p><strong>Advantages:</strong> Reduces fragmentation and improves access speed compared to linked allocation.</p>
            <p><strong>Drawback:</strong> Requires extra space for storing index blocks.</p>
            <p><strong>Use Cases:</strong> Modern file systems like <strong>NTFS</strong> use indexed allocation for efficient storage management.</p>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>4. Access Methods</h2>
            <p>The method used to access data in files is important for system performance. There are several access methods used for reading and writing files:</p>

            <h3>a. Sequential Access</h3>
            <p><strong>Definition:</strong> Records are processed one after another, from start to finish.</p>
            <p><strong>Use Cases:</strong> This method is suitable for scenarios like reading log files or processing data in a stream.</p>
            <p><strong>Example:</strong> Reading a text file line by line.</p>
            <p><strong>Limitations:</strong> Searching or modifying specific records is slow since the entire file must be scanned sequentially.</p>

            <h3>b. Direct (Random) Access</h3>
            <p><strong>Definition:</strong> Allows for accessing any record directly, without needing to traverse the file in a sequential manner.</p>
            <p><strong>Use Cases:</strong> Databases, file systems with random file retrieval needs.</p>
            <p><strong>Example:</strong> Directly accessing a record in a database using a unique ID.</p>
            <p><strong>Advantages:</strong> Fast access to specific records.</p>
