        <h2>Ecological Interaction: A Deep Dive</h2>
        
        <div class="sub-field">
            <h3>1. Types of Ecological Interactions</h3>
            <p>Ecological interactions refer to the various relationships between organisms and their environment, as well as between different organisms within an ecosystem. These interactions shape the structure of ecosystems and determine the distribution and abundance of species. The different types of interactions between species can be classified as positive, negative, or neutral. Let’s explore these interactions in more depth:</p>
        </div>

        <div class="sub-field">
            <h3>a. Interspecific Interactions</h3>
            <p>Interspecific interactions are interactions that occur between individuals of different species. These interactions can have positive, negative, or neutral effects on the species involved. The main types of interspecific interactions are:</p>

            <h3>i. Competition</h3>
            <p>Competition occurs when two or more species vie for the same limited resources such as food, water, light, or space. There are two types of competition: intraspecific (between individuals of the same species) and interspecific (between individuals of different species).</p>

            <h3>ii. Predation</h3>
            <p>Predation is an interaction where one organism (the predator) kills and consumes another organism (the prey). This interaction is beneficial for the predator but harmful to the prey.</p>

            <h3>iii. Mutualism</h3>
            <p>Mutualism is a symbiotic relationship where both species benefit from the interaction. This is a positive interaction for both species involved.</p>

            <h3>iv. Commensalism</h3>
            <p>In a commensal relationship, one species benefits from the interaction, while the other is neither harmed nor benefited.</p>

            <h3>v. Parasitism</h3>
            <p>Parasitism is a relationship where one organism (the parasite) benefits at the expense of another organism (the host). The parasite depends on the host for nourishment or shelter, often harming the host in the process.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="sub-field">
            <h3>b. Intraspecific Interactions</h3>
            <p>Intraspecific interactions occur within the same species. These interactions often involve competition for resources or opportunities to mate, as well as cooperative behaviors that enhance survival.</p>

            <h3>i. Cooperation</h3>
            <p>Cooperation refers to interactions in which individuals of the same species work together to achieve a common goal, benefiting all involved.</p>

            <h3>ii. Territoriality</h3>
            <p>Territoriality involves the defense of a specific area or territory against intruders. This is common in many species, especially those that rely on fixed resources like food, mates, or nesting sites.</p>

            <h3>iii. Mating Behavior</h3>
            <p>Intraspecific interactions also include competition for mates. Mating behavior can involve physical competition, display behaviors, or rituals to attract mates.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="sub-field">
            <h3>2. Ecological Succession</h3>
            <p>Ecological succession is the process by which ecosystems change and develop over time. It is the gradual replacement of one community by another, often resulting from a disturbance or the creation of a new habitat.</p>

            <h3>a. Primary Succession</h3>
            <p>Primary succession occurs in areas that have not previously been colonized by life, such as bare rock after a volcanic eruption or glaciers retreating.</p>

            <h3>b. Secondary Succession</h3>
            <p>Secondary succession occurs in areas where life has previously existed but has been disturbed, such as after a forest fire or agricultural field abandonment.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="sub-field">
            <h3>3. Energy Flow and Trophic Levels</h3>
            <p>Energy flow through ecosystems involves various trophic levels. Producers form the base of the food chain, and energy moves upward as one organism consumes another. The 10% Rule describes the efficiency of energy transfer between trophic levels.</p>

            <h3>Energy Transfer Efficiency Formula</h3>
            <div class="formula">
                Energy Efficiency = (Energy Passed to Next Trophic Level) / (Energy Available from Previous Level) × 100
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="sub-field">
            <h3>4. Human Impact on Ecological Interactions</h3>
            <p>Humans have a profound impact on ecological interactions, from habitat destruction to climate change. Major impacts include deforestation, pollution, and climate change, which can disrupt species’ relationships and ecosystem dynamics.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="sub-field">
            <h3>5. Biodiversity and Ecosystem Stability</h3>
            <p>Biodiversity plays a critical role in the stability of ecosystems. More diverse ecosystems tend to be more resilient to disturbances, and high biodiversity helps ensure ecosystem functions, such as nutrient cycling, pollination, and pest control.</p>
