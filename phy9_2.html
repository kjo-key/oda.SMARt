        <h2>Physical Quantities: An Overview</h2>
        <p>Physical quantities are the properties of matter and energy that can be measured. They can be classified into two broad categories: <strong>Scalar quantities</strong> and <strong>Vector quantities</strong>.</p>
        
        <h2>1. Scalar Quantities</h2>
        <p>Scalar quantities are those that are fully described by a magnitude (numerical value) alone. They do not have a direction associated with them.</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Mass (m):</strong> The amount of matter in an object, measured in kilograms (kg).</li>
            <li><strong>Time (t):</strong> A measure of the duration of events, measured in seconds (s).</li>
            <li><strong>Temperature (T):</strong> A measure of the heat content of a body, measured in Kelvin (K) or Celsius (°C).</li>
            <li><strong>Energy (E):</strong> The capacity to do work, measured in joules (J).</li>
            <li><strong>Speed (v):</strong> The rate of motion, measured in meters per second (m/s).</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Formula Example for Speed:</h3>
        <pre>
        v = d / t
        Where:
        v = speed (m/s),
        d = distance (m),
        t = time (s).
        </pre>

        <h2>2. Vector Quantities</h2>
        <p>Vector quantities are those that require both a magnitude and a direction to be fully described.</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Displacement (s):</strong> A vector that describes the change in position of an object, measured in meters (m).</li>
            <li><strong>Velocity (v):</strong> The rate of change of displacement, measured in meters per second (m/s).</li>
            <li><strong>Force (F):</strong> An interaction that causes an object to change its motion, measured in newtons (N).</li>
            <li><strong>Acceleration (a):</strong> The rate of change of velocity, measured in meters per second squared (m/s²).</li>
            <li><strong>Momentum (p):</strong> The product of an object's mass and velocity, measured in kilogram meters per second (kg·m/s).</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Formula Example for Velocity:</h3>
        <pre>
        v = Δs / Δt
        Where:
        v = velocity (m/s),
        Δs = change in position (m),
        Δt = change in time (s).
        </pre>

        <h2>Fundamental Physical Quantities</h2>
        
        <h3>1. Length (L)</h3>
        <p>Length is a fundamental physical quantity representing the distance between two points. It is typically measured in meters (m).</p>
        <pre>
        L = |x2 - x1|
        </pre>

        <h3>2. Mass (m)</h3>
        <p>Mass is the measure of the amount of matter in an object, typically measured in kilograms (kg). Mass is a scalar quantity and remains constant regardless of location.</p>

        <h3>3. Time (t)</h3>
        <p>Time is the duration of events and is measured in seconds (s). It is a scalar quantity and is a basic dimension in physics.</p>

        <h2>Derived Physical Quantities</h2>

        <h3>1. Force (F)</h3>
        <p>Force is an interaction that changes the motion of an object. The unit of force is the <strong>newton (N)</strong>, where 1 N = 1 kg·m/s².</p>
        <pre>
        F = m * a
        Where:
        F = force (N),
        m = mass (kg),
        a = acceleration (m/s²).
        </pre>

        <h3>2. Work (W)</h3>
        <p>Work is the transfer of energy when a force is applied to an object causing displacement. The unit of work is the <strong>joule (J)</strong>.</p>
        <pre>
        W = F * d * cos(θ)
        Where:
        W = work (J),
        F = force (N),
        d = displacement (m),
        θ = angle between the force and displacement direction.
        </pre>

        <h3>3. Energy (E)</h3>
        <p>Energy is the capacity to do work. It is measured in joules (J).</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Kinetic Energy (KE):</strong> The energy of motion.
                <pre>KE = ½ * m * v²</pre>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Potential Energy (PE):</strong> The energy stored due to an object’s position or configuration.
                <pre>PE = m * g * h</pre>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>4. Power (P)</h3>
        <p>Power is the rate at which work is done or energy is transferred. The unit of power is the <strong>watt (W)</strong>.</p>
        <pre>
        P = W / t
        Where:
        P = power (W),
        W = work (J),
        t = time (s).
        </pre>

        <h3>5. Momentum (p)</h3>
        <p>Momentum is the product of an object’s mass and velocity. The unit of momentum is <strong>kilogram meter per second (kg·m/s)</strong>.</p>
        <pre>
        p = m * v
        Where:
        p = momentum (kg·m/s),
        m = mass (kg),
        v = velocity (m/s).
        </pre>

        <h3>6. Acceleration (a)</h3>
        <p>Acceleration is the rate of change of velocity. The unit of acceleration is <strong>meters per second squared (m/s²)</strong>.</p>
        <pre>
        a = Δv / Δt
        Where:
        a = acceleration (m/s²),
        Δv = change in velocity (m/s),
        Δt = change in time (s).
        </pre>

        <h3>7. Pressure (P)</h3>
        <p>Pressure is the force applied per unit area. The unit of pressure is the <strong>pascal (Pa)</strong), where 1 Pa = 1 N/m².</p>
        <pre>
        P = F / A
        Where:
        P = pressure (Pa),
        F = force (N),
        A = area (m²).
        </pre>

        <h2>SI Units and Dimensional Formula</h2>
        <p>The SI system (International System of Units) is used globally for measuring physical quantities. Each physical quantity has a corresponding unit and a <strong>dimensional formula</strong> that shows how the fundamental quantities (mass, length, and time) combine to form the unit.</p>

        <h3>Examples:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Force (F):</strong> SI unit = newton (N), dimensional formula = [M L T<sup>-2</sup>].</li>
            <li><strong>Energy (E):</strong> SI unit = joule (J), dimensional formula = [M L<sup>2</sup> T<sup>-2</sup>].</li>
            <li><strong>Power (P):</strong> SI unit = watt (W), dimensional formula = [M L<sup>2</sup> T<sup>-3</sup>].</li>
        </ul>
