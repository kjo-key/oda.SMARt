    <h1>Hydrocarbons and Their Natural Sources</h1>
    <p>Learn about the different types of hydrocarbons and their natural sources.</p>
  </header>

  <section class="content">
    <h2>Types of Hydrocarbons</h2>
    <h3>1. Alkanes (Saturated Hydrocarbons)</h3>
    <p>Alkanes contain only single bonds between carbon atoms. They are saturated because each carbon atom is bonded to as many hydrogen atoms as possible.</p>
    <pre>CnH2n+2 (e.g., CH4, C2H6)</pre>

    <h3>2. Alkenes (Unsaturated Hydrocarbons)</h3>
    <p>Alkenes contain at least one double bond between carbon atoms. They are unsaturated because they have fewer hydrogen atoms compared to alkanes.</p>
    <pre>CnH2n (e.g., C2H4, C3H6)</pre>

    <h3>3. Alkynes (Unsaturated Hydrocarbons)</h3>
    <p>Alkynes contain at least one triple bond between carbon atoms, which also makes them unsaturated.</p>
    <pre>CnH2n-2 (e.g., C2H2, C3H4)</pre>

    <h3>4. Aromatic Hydrocarbons (Arenes)</h3>
    <p>Aromatic hydrocarbons contain a ring structure with alternating single and double bonds between carbon atoms. The most common example is benzene.</p>
    <pre>C6H6 (e.g., Benzene)</pre>

    <h2>Sources of Hydrocarbons</h2>
    <h3>1. Natural Gas</h3>
    <p>Natural gas is primarily made up of methane (CH4) but also contains small amounts of ethane, propane, and butane.</p>

    <h3>2. Crude Oil (Petroleum)</h3>
    <p>Crude oil is a mixture of hydrocarbons found in various forms, from light gases to heavier liquids and solids.</p>

    <h3>3. Coal</h3>
    <p>Coal is a solid form of carbon-based fuel that primarily contains hydrocarbons. It is used for energy production.</p>

    <h3>4. Biomass</h3>
    <p>Biomass includes materials like wood and agricultural waste that contain hydrocarbons and can be converted into energy.</p>

    <h3>5. Shale Oil</h3>
    <p>Shale oil is extracted from shale rock formations and contains hydrocarbons that can be converted into liquid petroleum.</p>

    <h2>Important Reactions of Hydrocarbons</h2>
    <h3>1. Combustion</h3>
    <pre>CxHy + O2 → CO2 + H2O</pre>
    <p>Example: CH4 + 2 O2 → CO2 + 2 H2O</p>

    <h3>2. Substitution (For Alkanes)</h3>
    <pre>CH4 + Cl2 → CH3Cl + HCl</pre>

    <h3>3. Addition (For Alkenes and Alkynes)</h3>
    <pre>C2H4 + H2 → C2H6</pre>

    <h3>4. Cracking</h3>
    <pre>C6H14 → C4H10 + C2H4</pre>

    <h3>5. Polymerization (For Alkenes)</h3>
    <pre>nC2H4 → -(C2H4)n-</pre>

    <h2>Properties of Hydrocarbons</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Physical State: Alkanes can be gases or liquids (e.g., methane, octane).</li>
      <li>Solubility: Hydrocarbons are non-polar and insoluble in water, but soluble in organic solvents.</li>
      <li>Density: Most hydrocarbons have a lower density than water.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Examples and Uses of Hydrocarbons</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Methane (CH4): Used as natural gas for heating and cooking.</li>
      <li>Ethane (C2H6): Used as a fuel and as a starting material in the production of ethylene.</li>
      <li>Propane (C3H8): Used as a fuel for heating, cooking, and vehicles.</li>
      <li>Benzene (C6H6): Used in the production of plastics, resins, and synthetic fibers.</li>
    </ul>
