        <h2>Overview of Plants</h2>
        <p>Plants are multicellular organisms that belong to the kingdom Plantae. They play an essential role in Earth's ecosystems, contributing oxygen through photosynthesis and serving as the foundation for food webs. Plants are autotrophic, meaning they make their own food using sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="sub-field">
        <h3>Key Concepts in Plant Biology</h3>

        <h4>1. Photosynthesis</h4>
        <p>Photosynthesis is the process by which plants convert light energy, usually from the sun, into chemical energy stored in glucose. This process takes place in the chloroplasts, mainly in the leaves of plants.</p>
        <div class="formula">
            <p>6CO<sub>2</sub> + 6H<sub>2</sub>O + light energy → C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>6</sub> + 6O<sub>2</sub></p>
            <p><strong>Reactants:</strong> Carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>), Water (H<sub>2</sub>O), and Light Energy.</p>
            <p><strong>Products:</strong> Glucose (C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>6</sub>) and Oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>).</p>
        </div>
        <p>The light-dependent reactions occur in the thylakoid membranes and convert light energy into chemical energy in the form of ATP and NADPH. The light-independent reactions (Calvin Cycle) occur in the stroma of the chloroplasts and use ATP and NADPH to convert carbon dioxide into glucose.</p>

        <h4>2. Plant Growth and Development</h4>
        <p>Plants grow through both primary and secondary growth:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Primary Growth:</strong> Refers to the elongation of the plant (vertical growth) from the apical meristems located at the tips of the shoots and roots.</li>
            <li><strong>Secondary Growth:</strong> Involves the thickening of the plant body (increase in girth) through lateral meristems like the vascular cambium and cork cambium, mainly seen in woody plants.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>3. Plant Reproduction</h4>
        <p>Plants can reproduce both sexually and asexually. Sexual reproduction involves the production of seeds through the fusion of male and female gametes (pollen and ovules). Asexual reproduction occurs through vegetative parts such as roots, stems, and leaves.</p>

        <h4>4. Transpiration</h4>
        <p>Transpiration is the process of water movement through a plant and its evaporation from aerial parts, mainly the leaves. It plays a crucial role in maintaining water balance, cooling the plant, and enabling the uptake of nutrients.</p>
        <div class="formula">
            <p>E = Water loss (g) / Time (hours)</p>
            <p><strong>E:</strong> Transpiration rate</p>
            <p><strong>Water loss:</strong> Amount of water lost through transpiration</p>
            <p><strong>Time:</strong> Duration over which the transpiration is measured.</p>
        </div>

        <h4>5. Respiration in Plants</h4>
        <p>Plants undergo cellular respiration to convert glucose into usable energy in the form of ATP. Cellular respiration occurs in the mitochondria of plant cells.</p>
        <div class="formula">
            <p>C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>6</sub> + 6O<sub>2</sub> → 6CO<sub>2</sub> + 6H<sub>2</sub>O + ATP</p>
            <p><strong>Reactants:</strong> Glucose (C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>6</sub>) and Oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>).</p>
            <p><strong>Products:</strong> Carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>), Water (H<sub>2</sub>O), and ATP.</p>
        </div>

        <h4>6. Water Transport in Plants (Xylem and Phloem)</h4>
        <p>The plant vascular system consists of two main tissues: xylem, which transports water and minerals from the roots to the leaves, and phloem, which transports the products of photosynthesis from the leaves to other parts of the plant.</p>
        <div class="formula">
            <p>Ψ = Ψ<sub>s</sub> + Ψ<sub>p</sub></p>
            <p><strong>Ψ:</strong> Water potential</p>
            <p><strong>Ψ<sub>s</sub>:</strong> Solute potential (osmotic potential)</p>
            <p><strong>Ψ<sub>p</sub>:</strong> Pressure potential (physical pressure on the water).</p>
        </div>

        <h4>7. Plant Nutrition</h4>
        <p>Plants require a variety of nutrients for growth, including macronutrients like nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, as well as micronutrients like iron, zinc, and copper.</p>
        <div class="formula">
            <p>N<sub>2</sub> + 8H<sup>+</sup> + 8e<sup>-</sup> → 2NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup></p>
            <p><strong>N<sub>2</sub>:</strong> Atmospheric nitrogen</p>
            <p><strong>H<sup>+</sup>:</strong> Protons</p>
            <p><strong>e<sup>-</sup>:</strong> Electrons</p>
            <p><strong>NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>:</strong> Ammonium ion</p>
        </div>
